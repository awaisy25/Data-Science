# Data-Science
Projects I have done in my Data Science course.
I have done the following:
- Sentimenatal Analysis with a yahoo review file
- Web scraping program that counts seed tags from stack overflow
- Program that anaylzes the chatter flow from Forbes data sets 
- Crime anaylsis that uses pandas to look into insights
- Cluster analysis based on test scores
